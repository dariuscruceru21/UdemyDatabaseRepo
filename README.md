--This project represents the backend and database layer for an online course provider platform.

--The database is implemented using PostgreSQL, which ensures robust support for relational data and scalabilitys.

--The platform aims to streamline interactions between students and instructors, offering features like course enrollment, assignments,
  quizzes, and progress tracking, while maintaining efficient data management and secure operations.

--The systemâ€™s backend interacts with a dynamic and user-friendly UI, enabling seamless integration of various functionalities.
  These include not only basic CRUD operations but also advanced sorting, filtering, and grading features that cater to the needs of both students and instructors.

1)Advanced Sorting and Filtering: The UI integrates complex sorting and filtering mechanisms for courses, assignments, and students.

  and instructor rating while applying multi-criteria sorting to arrange data based on relevance, date, or score.
  
2)Student Quizzes: Students can participate in quizzes designed to evaluate their understanding of the course material.
  The system supports dynamic quiz generation and real-time scoring, providing immediate feedback to the users.
  
3)Instructor Assignment Grading: Instructors have access to tools for grading submitted assignments. They can view and evaluate student submissions
  and provide personalized feedback efficiently.
